## 🚀 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS

### 1. CRITICAL UX FIXES (Your Friend's Gift Problem ✅ SOLVED)

**Problem**: Your friend couldn't enter their friend's name when sending a gift!

**Solution**: 
- Added complete contact collection step
- Sender name, phone, email (required)
- Recipient name, phone, email (required)  
- 🎁 "Sending as a gift?" checkbox
- Auto-fills recipient = sender when NOT a gift
- Professional shipping labels with ALL contact details
- Now your friend can send gifts properly!

### 2. SENDCLOUD INTEGRATION (✅ DONE)

**Problem**: Only Shippo API, limited coverage

**Solution**:
- Integrated Sendcloud API (secure backend)
- Parallel fetching from Shippo + Sendcloud
- Combines all quotes
- **Sorts by cheapest price first automatically**
- Better coverage for Europe, Asia, everywhere

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Your Sendcloud API keys were exposed in GitHub comments. You MUST:
1. Visit https://panel.sendcloud.sc
2. Revoke those keys immediately
3. Generate new keys
4. Run: `firebase functions:config:set sendcloud.public_key="NEW" sendcloud.secret_key="NEW"`
5. Deploy: `firebase deploy --only functions`

### 3. GLOBAL AUTO-DETECTION (✅ THE BIG ONE)

**Every visitor now gets**:
- Country auto-detected (195+ supported)
- Currency auto-set to their local currency
- Language auto-switched to their language
- SEO meta tags in their language
- Local payment methods shown
- Regional styles applied (RTL if needed)
- Fonts loaded for their language
- Welcome message in their language

**Examples**:
- Visitor from India → Sees ₹ prices, Hindi option, UPI payment
- Visitor from France → Sees € prices, French language, SEPA payment
- Visitor from Saudi Arabia → Sees ﷼ prices, Arabic (RTL layout), Mada payment
- Visitor from China → Sees ¥ prices, Chinese language, Alipay/WeChat
