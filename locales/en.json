        "question": "What is the difference between FCL and LCL?",
        "answer": "FCL (Full Container Load) means you rent an entire shipping container for your cargo - ideal for large shipments. LCL (Less than Container Load) means your cargo shares container space with other shippers' goods - perfect for smaller shipments that don't need a full container.",

        "category": "Booking"

      {
        "question": "What are customs duties and who pays them?",
        "answer": "Customs duties are taxes imposed by the destination country on imported goods. These are paid by the importer (consignee) and are based on the cargo value, type, and country of origin. We can provide estimates but exact amounts are determined by customs authorities.",
        "category": "Shipping"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I create an account?",

        "category": "Shipping"
      },
      {
        "question": "What are prohibited items?",
        "answer": "Commonly prohibited items include weapons, explosives, illegal drugs, counterfeit goods, and perishable food items (for most services).
